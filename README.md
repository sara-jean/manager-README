# Sara's Manager README

# What is this?

A README file is often the first item a visitor will check when visiting a code repository. This Manager README is a living document that introduces you to my management style, expectations, and me!

# My role
I’m here to support you by making sure you have the tools, skills, space, and context needed to do your job effectively. 

## What you can expect from me
I strongly believe in and uphold the company Core Values in all the work I do. Some of the personal values behind my management style include…
- Diversity: We all have something to learn from each other when we take the time to listen
- Autonomy: Giving team members space to learn, grow, make decisions, and be accountable for their own work
- Transparency: Being as open as possible about what’s going on with our team, department, and the company 
- Feedback: Taking and providing honest and frequent feedback so that we both can grow

If you feel I’m not meeting any of these expectations, please let me know! 

# What I expect from you
- Proactively reach out for support or clarity 
- Show up when you’re supposed to
- Deliver what’s due when it’s due
- Always aim for your highest quality work

# Logistics
## Office hours
I’m usually in the office around 8am-4:30pm Pacific, with occasional work from home days. I like to spread my work out over the day, so you may see me on Slack or answering emails after business hours. 

## Calendaring
Keep your Outlook calendar up to date. When you’ll be out of office, [block off your time and send a separate courtesy OOO invite](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-time-away-from-the-office-to-coworkers-outlook-calendars-69fe38aa-7b5f-4225-8b69-47f47092e65e) to your me and your direct team.

## 1:1s
This is _your time and space_ to ask questions, share feedback, brainstorm, or chat about anything on your mind. The cadence (bi-weekly, monthly) and medium (video, voice, chat) is up to you. It is OK to decline a 1:1 or to request an off-schedule one. You’ll also be invited to occasional skip-level 1:1s with my manager.

In our first 1:1, we’ll cover your expectations and preferences:
- Preferred methods of communication
- What motivates you
- Your expectations for career development
- Development areas I can help you with
- Anything else I should be aware of in working with you (pet peeves, preferences, pronouns, etc.)

##  Reaching out

You don’t have to wait until our 1:1s to reach out to me. 

The best ways to reach me are:
1. Slack
2. Email
3. Zoom / at my desk
4. Phone

# TL;DR

- Let me know how I can best help you
- There’s no such thing as over-communicating (probably)
